I've had some time to think on the boss switching and I'm going to change that folder name from 'bosses' to 'profiles'.


Simply, I want users to be able to create profiles of their own which may differ from the stock boss profile, regardless of whether that's at a different boss or just a custom solak profile.


Can you rename the display tab of our settings to 'General' and implement a profile dropdown with a 'load' button besides it, which switches the config to the selected profile.


We should load every .ts file in the profiles directory into this dropdown, with the exception of 'example-profile.ts'. This serves solely as a well documented example profile for editors on the github side of things. It can be omitted from this dropdown.


On load, we need the mechanics and notifications tabs to update in accordance to the profile.


I would also like to make the audio objects buildable as part of the preset, as some scripts may not require the additional settings, or may require even more customisation options!
